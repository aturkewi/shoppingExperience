#Shopping Experience

@mendelB and I built out this simple domain with some mock data to help play around and learn some Advanced Active Record queries. I then wrote up a short [blog](http://aturkewi.github.io//advanced-active-record-queries/) on what we learned with it. I wanted to post up the source data that we used to play around with in case anyone else wanted to play around with it as well.

##Set Up
 - Fork and clone this repository
 - `cd` to the repository directory in your terminal
 - Run `bundle install` from your terminal
 - Run `rake db:seed` from your terminal to add all the data
 - Run `rails c` from your terminal to start playing around with the data!
